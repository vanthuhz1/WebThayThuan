   CUSTOM STYLES - Additional overrides only
   ============================================ */
/* 
   NOTE: Base styles, containers, and utilities are defined in index.css
   This file should only contain additional custom styles that don't conflict
   with index.css or Tailwind CSS.
   
   Removed duplicate styles to prevent CSS conflicts:
   - Base styles (*, body) -> moved to index.css
   - Container styles -> moved to index.css  
   - Utility classes (d-flex, etc.) -> moved to index.css
   - Bootstrap grid fixes -> moved to index.css
   - Responsive utilities -> moved to index.css
   - .hidden override removed (conflicts with Tailwind)
